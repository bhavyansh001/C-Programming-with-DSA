Linear data structures included arrays, linked lists, and stacks, while nonlinear hierarchical data structures included Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees. Graphs are an example of non-linear data structures. A graph is a collection of nodes connected through edges. A tree is also a collection of nodes and edges, and hence is a graph

A vertex or node is one fundamental unit/entity of which graphs are formed. Nodes are the data containing parts, connected with each other using edges. An edge is uniquely defined by its 2 endpoints or the two nodes it is connecting

Applications including their use to model real-world problems like managing a social network, website links, etc.
Another major application is their use to solve problems like is there a path between two locations on a map and if there is, which one is the shortest

Types of Edges:
1. Directed Edge-  Hyperlink, where one can even link google.com to their own websites on the internet, but then google.com would not necessarily link your website to their page :)
2. Undirected Edge-  FACEBOOK’s friend feature, where if you make someone a friend, then you too become their friend, so it’s both ways

Types of Graphs:
1. Directed graph
2. Undirected graph

Indegree and Outdegree of a node

Ways to represent:
Adjacency List: The information about the connections of each of the nodes gets stored in separate linked lists
Adjacency Matrix: Cost Adjacency Matrix

There are two algorithms that are used for traversing a graph. They are:
Breadth-First Search (BFS): visit from left to right all the nodes which lie on the same level, uses queue
Depth First Search (DFS): visit from top to down all the nodes which are connected with each other, uses stack

Spanning trees are used to get the traversal order. It involves pivoting a node making a tree like structure, and removing duplicate lines

Subgraph, connected graph, complete graph
